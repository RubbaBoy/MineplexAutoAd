Description
-------------
Mineplex Auto Ad is an application that automatically watches the video ads for mineplex (http://www.mineplex.com) and get the rewards. This application allows you to get around 24 Carl spin tickets, as well 2,400 treasure shards per day. This can be run on an extra computer, or your main computer, just know every hour a google chrome window will appear on your screen, then disappear around 40 seconds later, with logging you out of mineplex, if any other instances are online.

Prerequisites
-------------
The items needed for this application to work properly are:
>- A premium Minecraft account, not banned from Mineplex
>- Google Chrome
>- Java 8 Installed

Disclaimer!
-------------
At the moment, this application is complient with all of the Mineplex rules, and has not triggered any false-positives, if there would be any by GWEN (Their anticheat), after over a week of 24/7 testing. I advise you every day or two to check to see if their rules have updated to disallow the automatic watching of their advertisements. If they impliment a rule stating you can get punished for this application, I will not be held responsible to any punishments you get.

How To Install/Use
-------------
Download the latest compiled file with its libraries [here](uddernetworks.com/file_download/MineplexAutoAd.zip).
First, extract the zip folder into a file. Open the file, and you should see a .jar file, and a folder named **lib**. Open **lib**, and then **Minecraft Client**. Double click **MinecraftClient.ini** to open it with notepad, or whatever other text editor you prefer. After **login=** delete the test after it, and put in the username/email you usually use to login to minecraft/mojang. Do the same except with your password after **password=**. This is a seperate application, only opened by Mineplex Auto Ad, found [here](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-tools/1263927-win-mac-linux-minecraft-console-client-1-9-0). Save the file, and exit out of Notepad. Double click **MinecraftClient.exe**, and it should open a command window, and show the chat from Mineplex after some other text. You can exit out of the window, and go back from **Minecraft Client** and **lib**, so you see the .jar file. Double-Click **MineplexAutoAd.jar**, and you should see a window appear on your screen. Replace **Username** in the text box with the username of the account you put in the .ini file, and click start. Immediatly, the same .exe file should pop up, then a few seconds later a Google Chrome window will pop up. Muting features should be available soon, along with auto minimizing, but wait around 40 seconds for the ad to be viewed, and everything to close. Next hour this will happen, and you can view the number of times the Ad has been watched after **Times Watched:** in the window.
When you want to close the window, Just click **Stop**.
